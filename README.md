# whatsapp image name fixer
I transfer pictures from my phone to my Mac through WhatsApp but whenever I download the pictures from WhatsApp to my phone the name of the picture is something like "WhatsApp_time_stamp" now since most of these pictures that I transfer are pictures of my homework or exams that I need to upload through blackboard, this code allows me to rename all the downloaded pictures in order preserving the timeline.
